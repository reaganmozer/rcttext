\title{Extract predictions from a fitted text scoring model.}
\usage{
predict_scores(fit, X, Z)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{A list containing fitted models for two groups (typically treatment and control). The list should include `mod0` for group 0 and `mod1` for group 1, along with a binary vector `coded` indicating which documents are part of the coded subset.}

\item{X}{A data frame or matrix of predictor variables used for making predictions.}

\item{Z}{A binary vector indicating group membership (e.g., 0 for control, 1 for treatment).}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of predicted scores for all documents.
}
\description{
This function calculates predicted scores for all documents based on fitted models. It handles both in-sample and out-of-sample predictions for different groups.
}
\examples{
# Example usage with hypothetical data
fit <- list(mod0 = lm(Y ~ X1 + X2, data = data0), mod1 = lm(Y ~ X1 + X2, data = data1), coded = c(1, 0, 1, 0, 1))
X <- data.frame(X1 = rnorm(100), X2 = rnorm(100))
Z <- sample(c(0, 1), 100, replace = TRUE)
yhat <- predict_scores(fit, X, Z)
print(yhat)
