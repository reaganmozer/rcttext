\title{Train an ensemble learner for semi-supervised text scoring}
\usage{
train_ensemble(
  X,
  Z = NULL,
  Yobs,
  coded,
  n.tune = 3,
  bounds = NULL,
  preProc = "zv",
  model = "rf",

}
\arguments{
\item{X}{a \code{data.frame} or matrix of numeric text features.}

\item{Z}{optional indicator for treatment assignment. If specified,
separate ensembles will be trained for each treatment group;}

\item{Yobs}{a vector of human-coded scores for the outcome of
interest.}

\item{coded}{A binary vector indicating which documents have been
human coded.}

\item{n.tune}{an integer denoting the amount of granularity in the
tuning parameter grid. By default, this argument is the number of
levels for each tuning parameters that should be generated by
\link{train}.}

\item{bounds}{a vector (y1, y2) specifying the lower and upper
limits for prediction}

\item{...}{additional arguments passed to \link{trainControl}.}

\item{cvf}{number of folds for cross validation}

\item{return.all}{should all component models be returned? If
`FALSE`, returns only the fitted ensemble(s).}
}
\value{
a fitted model object
}
\description{
This function takes in a corpus of text documents or a set of
computed text features, along with a sample of human-coded outcome
values and trains an ensemble of machine learning models to predict
the outcome as a function of machine measures of text.
