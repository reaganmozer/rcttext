\title{Evaluate In-Sample and Out-of-Sample Performance of a Machine Learning Model}
\usage{
eval_model(yhat, Yobs, coded)
}
\arguments{
\item{yhat}{A numeric vector of predicted outcomes for the entire dataset.}

\item{Yobs}{A numeric vector of observed outcomes (ground truth) corresponding to the predictions in `yhat`.}

\item{coded}{A binary vector indicating whether a document was used for training (`1`) or testing (`0`).}
}
\value{
A data frame with the following performance measures for both in-sample and out-of-sample data:
\itemize{
  \item \code{ybar}: The mean of the predicted outcomes.
  \item \code{var.yhat}: The variance of the predicted outcomes.
  \item \code{R2}: The coefficient of determination (R-squared), indicating how well the predictions match the observed outcomes.
  \item \code{mse}: The mean squared error, representing the average squared difference between the predicted and observed outcomes.
}
}
\description{
This function calculates and records various performance measures for a machine learning model,
including in-sample (training) and out-of-sample (testing) metrics.

# Example usage with hypothetical data
yhat <- rnorm(100)
Yobs <- rnorm(100)
coded <- sample(c(0, 1), 100, replace = TRUE)
